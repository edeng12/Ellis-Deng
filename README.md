### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I’m Ellis Deng!

---

A Junior majoring in Information Science at the University of Maryland pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science and/or Analytics.

I'm a student who is passionate about analyzing data to do exploratory data analysis and to problem solve. Not only that, but also being able to identify trends in data sets through the utilization of programming languages.

I am currently working on a couple of projects that deal with scraping data from websites, cleaning data, performing a few types of analysis, doing exploratory data analysis, and much more.
